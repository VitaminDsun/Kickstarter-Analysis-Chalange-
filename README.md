#Deliverable 1
-Launch date

The purpose of this analysis is to provide Louise with a simplified and summarized version from the database provided. The first objective was to investigate some reasons (Launch Dates and Funding Goals). that could help Louise understand why their play Fever fell short of their funding goal. Some insights that have been found while looking over the data; Is that there could be a correlation with the time of the year that the Kickstarter was launched, out of the 1369 total Kickstarters that matched Louise’s criteria Plays, in the United States.  After working with the database, applying different filters, organizing the data, converting dates and times, I was able to establish that the most successful months to start a kickstarter; seem to be May, June, And July. (I have provided a line graph below to show my findings)  I personally feel this might be due to it being the summertime in the united states, people are out and about enjoying the good weather,  many children and young adults are on summer vacation; giving people more opportunity to do more family activities like going to the theater, and lastly a lot of theaters are air conditioned and this would also give a lot of people a cool place to chill out as well (Ha). With Louise starting their kickstarter in June, I would say one thing that could be attempted to see if they might be able to accomplish their funding goal would be to try and start it in May, it was a slightly more successful month then the one Louise selected. Another thing I would also recommend is not starting their kickstarter too much earlier because March and January seem to be the worst months to start a kickstarter for a play in the United States. Which will bring me to my second set of deliverables for this Dataset, percentage of success and failure based on funding goals.

#Deliverable 2

-Outcome Based on Goal

The next step was to investigate the funding goals, one way of doing this is to find the percentage of success and failure based on funding goal. I was able to do this by creating ranges for the goals funded from $1-$50000, I then found the number of each category (successful, failed, and canceled), Divided that by the total number of Kickstarters within that funding goal range, and multiplied that by 100 to get a percentage I then took that and created and line graph that would help demonstrate the information (See Graph Below). It took me a bit longer to find a trend within this dataset. I could see that smaller goals were more likely to succeed, and extremely high funding goals seemed to fail much more then they prospered. Which seemed normal. But after looking more and more I did notice one point that stood out to me the most and that was the funding goal of $15000-$19999. This point had a 50/50 chance, the idea I have for this point is that because it is higher than Louise’s goal of $2885.00, it seemed interesting to me I wondered “Is this a breaking point for Kickstarters?.” a lot of people would take a coin flip for up to $20,000 and to accomplish their goal. After looking into the data, I feel that if Louise wanted to try again would be to set the goal a little higher maybe even up to $20000 because if they were able to match their funding percentage of 86% with a higher goal of say $20000 That would equal an amount of $17,200, this would far exceed their previous goal. but it would also prove to not be a impossible thing to do proven that other kickstarters have much  higher funding goals and still succeeded, some limitations of this data set is that because we had to group the goals funded in the groups of $1000, and $5000. This does not allow us to see the Frequency of the amounts of goals funded because the points on the line represent any of the values in between these two points, another way we could visualize this data set and help alleviate this issue; would be to use a histogram this would allow us to have an insightful look at the frequency Distribution of the funding goals as well as allow us to still see the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarters.

#Conclusion

-Job Well Done 

A few other things we could looked at in this database; are the percentages funded for similar kickstarters around the same time of the year with similar funding goals. After analyzing the dataset, I have concluded that Louise was able to produce very good results and only a few recommendations could be made. Such as The Start Date of Kickstarter and A Higher Funding Goal. But to only have the Kickstarter up for a little under and month. As well as only missing their goal by $400; Louise did a fantastic job with this kickstarter and should have a lot of success, experience, and insights to build on; going into the future.
